1. Introduction                                      *vim-chef-introduction*

vim-chef is a Vim plugin which detects Chef cookbook and Chef-Repo files and
sets the filetype to 'ruby.chef'. This enables other plugins like Syntastic to
work with Chef files, e.g. running Foodcritic automatically on file save.

vim-chef also appends to Vim's 'path' to make 'gf' work on include_recipe
lines in Chef recipe files. For example, if you have these lines in your
cookbook's recipes/default.rb file: >

    1. include_recipe 'git'
    2. include_recipe 'git::source'
    3. include_recipe 'current_cookbook::my_other_recipe'
<
'gf' with the cursor on the recipes above would jump to
'git/recipes/default.rb', 'git/recipes/source.rb', and
current_cookbook/recipes/my_other_recipe' respectively.
